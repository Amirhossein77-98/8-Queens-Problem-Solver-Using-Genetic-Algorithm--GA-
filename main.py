"""
This is a Python program that implements a genetic algorithm for solving the 8-queens problem.
The 8-queens problem is a classic puzzle that asks how to place eight queens on a chessboard
such that none of them can attack each other. A queen can attack another queen if they are on the
same row, column, or diagonal.

The program uses the following steps to find a solution:

1. Initialize a population of random individuals (potential solutions).
2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual based on the number of non-attacking pairs of queens.
3. Select two parents from the population using rank selection.
4. Create two children from the parents using partially mapped crossover (PMX) and avoid duplicates.
5. Mutate the children by swapping two random positions with a dynamic mutation rate.
6. Add the children to the population and keep only the best individuals (elites).
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until a solution is found or a maximum number of generations is reached.
8. Display the solution as a board with queens.

The program uses some parameters to control the behavior of the genetic algorithm, such as:

- POPULATION_SIZE: The number of individuals in the population.
- NUM_GENERATIONS: The maximum number of generations to run the algorithm.
- MUTATION_RATE: The initial probability of mutating an individual.
- ELITE_CHROMOSOMES: The number of best individuals to keep in each generation.

The program also uses some helper functions to implement the genetic algorithm, such as:

- init_population: Creates a random population of individuals.
- fitness: Calculates the fitness of an individual based on the number of non-attacking pairs of queens.
- selection: Chooses two parents from the population using rank selection.
- crossover: Creates two children from the parents using partially mapped crossover (PMX) and avoid duplicates.
- mutation: Mutates an individual by swapping two random positions with a dynamic mutation rate.
- create_board: Displays an individual as a board with queens.

The program requires Python 3.x to run and does not depend on any external libraries or modules.
